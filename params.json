{"name":"Codesigntools","tagline":"","body":"### Co-Design Tools and Exercises\r\nThese are design tools and exercises that are available to you throughout the whole design process. We have suggested two rough categories to help you through the process of selecting appropriate design tools for the stage your project is at, but it is up to you to choose which order best suits your design process. If you use them well they can help you understand your users and organize the information and ideas you develop throughout the design process.\r\n\r\n### _During Your First User Visits_\r\n#### Lexicons\r\n![Example of a Lexicon](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3280468/11246673/c2869b6a-8dff-11e5-87cd-459decdae30e.png)\r\n\r\nYou user group might have it’s own set of technical terminology that they use to communicate. To understand your users and their needs, it’s important to notice if you don’t understand some of the words and acronyms your users use, and create some sort of dictionary that you can use to communicate what you have learned about their work as you move forward with the design process.\r\n\r\n#### Inspirational Designs\r\n![Example Inspirational Designs](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3280468/11246672/c282c760-8dff-11e5-8190-a547b0b39f13.png)\r\n\r\n> Example Insprational Design Text for the Venmo Application: Venmo was created as a new, easy way to electronically (through phone or webapp) exchange money between friends. After initially connecting a venmo account to their bank account, users can quickly get started using all features of the app (including cashing out to their bank account). Venmo allows users to not worry about carrying cash and lets friends ask their owed money in a not awkward way. One of the problems with self-checkout systems is that there are tedious to use. When paying for groceries, you have to go through a number of screens - coupons, verification, system processing to finally complete your transaction. For users that want to quickly go through self-checkout, this can be annoying and unwelcome. Combining a quick payment option such as venmo with a self-checkout system would make the process more streamlined. A combined system such as this would be targeted towards more tech-savvy users that use self-checkout frequently.\r\n\r\nBefore you start working on ideas for your project, it can be useful to get and idea of what people have already done in the same project space. Inspirational designs are products or services that are similar to your idea or serve the same user group as your application. Collect images and information about these projects and save them in a document as a reference for your design process.\r\n\r\n#### Values Chart\r\n![Example Values Chart](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3280468/11246671/c2826a72-8dff-11e5-8805-4eac76753d27.png)\r\n\r\nIt is important to keep track of the values your users hold. This can be done by listing all of the values your users have expressed to you through user visits and plotting them on a chart. Values are broad preferences concerning appropriate courses of action or outcomes that reflect a person’s sense of right and wrong and tend to influence attitudes and behavior.\r\n\r\n#### Task Decompositions\r\nNarrow down the tasks you want users to be able to do in your application. For each of these tasks, break them down into smaller chunks that the user will have to execute. For example if a user wanted to take the blood pressure of a patient using an application hooked up to pressure cuff, what steps do they have to take? If you observe your users doing a task in one of your first user visit, record what they are doing and ask questions about why they are doing it. Create some sort of flowchart or diagram that describes this activity and then use it to inform the design of your prototype.\r\n\r\n#### Task Analysis Chart\r\n![Example Task Analysis Chart](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3280468/11246670/c2812496-8dff-11e5-96a3-62c7f385f564.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe task analysis chart is a really good way to prioritize screens and actions your user will need to be able to use and do to use your application. First you make a poster that has two axes with frequency and necessity, as above. Then you can create post it notes for all the things you want a user to be able to do in your application and rank those post it notes accordingly. Things that are high in necessity and in frequency should be in the front and center of your application  design, users should not have to go looking for these things. Things that are low in necessity and frequency are okay to put somewhere less central in the application.\r\n\r\n### _After Your First User Visits, Moving Towards Prototyping_ \r\n#### Personas\r\nThese are fictional users created to represent the different user types that you have encountered on your user vists. Personas make it easier to continuously integrate the needs and values of different types of users into your design decisions. They should be specific enough that you are able to make design decisions based off of what you think their opinion would be. We have provided two examples of personas here for you. The first one (Ruby) is a draft persona that was made earlier in the design process, and the second persona (Alex) is an example of a more complete persona. If you want to learn more about personas and their role in user centered design, this [link](https://gibbon.co/UXdesign/ux-personas) has excellent articles.\r\n\r\n![Example of a Rough Persona](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3280468/11246669/c2696662-8dff-11e5-83f5-5939da331183.png)\r\n\r\n#### Alex the Athlete\r\n![Example of a More Complete Persona](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3280468/11246666/c265e62c-8dff-11e5-9532-bb17ada55bd6.jpg)\r\n\r\nAlex has been playing soccer since he could walk and it is an integral part of his life. In one of his games last month, Alex strained the ligaments in his ankle while going after a loose ball. He has started seeing a physical therapist twice a week and does the exercises at home every day. Alex is very diligent about doing the exercises at home because he knows that will get him back out on the field the quickest.\r\n\r\nNeeds:\r\n* distraction from his injury/pain\r\n* confidence in his ability to perform each new exercise\r\n* reassurance that he is doing his PT correctly\r\n\r\nValues:\r\n* Health\r\n* Not being constrained by injury\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\n* To play soccer again soon, he will do whatever it takes.\r\n\r\n#### Scenarios\r\nA scenario is a concrete story about how a user would interact with your app. It provides context for the problems you are trying to solve and helps you decide which features and functions are most important and most frequently used. In your scenario you should describe who is using your app, what their motivation is, the context in which they are using it, and what the outcome is. It is one of the most useful tools in user testing. \r\nWhen user testing, give the user a scenario, and have them try use your application in the context of that scenario. Do this with each of your scenarios. They should be able to use the application to complete the scenario without help from you. If they need help, make a note of that, your application might need some adjustments to make it more user friendly.\r\n\r\n> Example scenario for a physical therapy app: Alex is given a new set of exercises to complete each day this week. Tuesday is the first day he is on his own at home. He checks the app before he starts exercising to remind himself of the set of exercises he is to complete at home this week. Some he has not done at home before, so he looks at the diagram/instructions/demonstration for each exercise. As he completes each exercise, he is unsure of what muscles he is supposed to be feeling so he looks at the diagram again to see how he should be doing the current exercise, including motions, reps, and duration.\r\n\r\n#### Experience Maps\r\n![Example Experience Map](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3280468/11246665/c2654690-8dff-11e5-8e82-12d3ce44e95d.png)\r\n\r\nAn experience map shows the different steps a user must go through to accomplish their task and interactions along the way. This includes not only what they are actually doing at each step, but what they are thinking and feeling along the way.\r\n\r\n### Contextual Inquiry Models\r\n#### Flow Models\r\n##### Information Flow Model\r\n![Example Flow Model](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3280468/11246667/c267792e-8dff-11e5-8669-d7e150eab02d.JPG)\r\n\r\n##### Interaction Flow Model\r\n![Example Interaction Flow Model](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2PSmDCFu3HyF7K865CfcLwxXDmeGUFW2KUHgey_3LYujrAzh3MpAfmh1SxwF6WPMZ4w2bamg4ZoN56HILd5TqDnGZG7Ei1d5Kd_nuo_MEI5PzEur8Itb0fnG6fPJpsMpzOVqimEw)\r\n\r\nThese models can be used to show the relationship between people and information in your problem space. Flow models can also be used later on in the design process to map out the interaction between the views/screens in your app and how each view is related.\r\n\r\n#### Physical Models\r\n![Example of a Physical Model](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3280468/11246668/c267e2b0-8dff-11e5-8a64-6405eada22e3.JPG)\r\n\r\nSometimes your users will be using physical tools while they are using your application. In order to consider what they user is actually having to work with when they use your application, you can create physical models of some of the tools they use in order to get into their shoes. Physical models can be very crude or well made, depending on what will help you most in the design process. This is a good opportunity to use your creativity and the fab lab to aid your design process and help you understand your user.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
